              <br />
              <p>
                Hi I'm Jared. I'm currently a project/product manager at
                Pakpobox, where we try to make the world a better place by
                putting your parcels into metal boxes.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm originally from Sydney and have been in Hong Kong for 3
                years now. I'm a trained civil engineer, with a strong interest
                in coastal management. I still love the beach, and look to clean
                them up whenever I can, but made the move into IT project
                management after coming to Hong Kong.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have lots of hobbies (I can't really focus on any one thing),
                including hiking, travelling (which will become really obvious
                on the other page), and photography. I try to combine all three
                things, but the weekends I am in Hong Kong I can be found on the
                trails. I'm also heavily interested in music and dabble with
                guitar (I enjoy it. I'm not Van Halen.).
                <br />
                <br />
                I've just started learning front-end web development with
                Xccelerate, which I'm enjoying a lot. I really want to
                understand how the development team I work with at Pakpobox
                thinks, and what difficulties they encounter in their day-to-day
                work. After completing the front-end web course, I'm hoping to
                move onto learning some programming languages better suited for
                backend work.. and maybe one day start my own company and
                develop my own product.

                <p>
                  I absolutely love to get out of Hong Kong! When I can fly and
                  I have a long weekend, I am usually somwewhere else in Asia.
                  Coming from Australia, it was pretty hard to get out; the
                  closest country larger than Tasmania (Indonesia in case you
                  were curious) which isn't New Zealand is 8 hours away by
                  plane! I'm not particularly fussed on where I go, but once
                  COVID-19 is over I'm planning on going on a few treks in
                  Central Asia and in Africa. To the right are a few of my
                  better or more memorable photos- I really need to remember to
                  take more!

                      <p>
                        In 2017 I went to Nepal over the Christmas break. I
                        travelled around the Kathmandu Basin before meeting up
                        with my sister, who went on to Everest base Camp. This
                        photo was taken in the middle of me getting scammed.
                      </p>

                    <div class="carousel-item">
                      <img
                        class="d-block w-100"

                      />
                      <p>
                        The first of my many trips in 2018 was to Taiwan, where
                        I managed to see the Pingxi Lantern festival. The square
                        where they released the lanterns was so crowded, but it
                        was definitely worth it to get there early and have a
                        front-row seat!
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="carousel-item">

                      <p>
                        I head to Japan fairly often (when we can fly), but this
                        was a special trip with my parents. We spent a day in
                        the Mt Fuji region, where I walked them to exhaustion. I
                        think they thought it was worth it when they saw Mt
                        Fuji, though.

                      <p>
                        I love ruins, so I definitely had to go to Angkor in
                        Cambodia. If you're lucky sunrise can be amazing, but
                        you can nearly guarantee that there will be half of Siem
                        Reap with you. The Angkor complex is so huge I spent a
                        whole day there - I didn't eve see half of it!
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        When one of my mates told me he was moving to Shanghai,
                        we agreed that we'd have to visit each others cities.
                        Well only half of that happened. It was really fun and I
                        want to go again; it feels completely different to the
                        Guangdong province, which I'm more familiar with.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In 2019 I climbed Mt Fuji's Yoshida Trail. It was so
                        foggy I actually never saw the summit until I stood on
                        it! While climbing I met quite a few people from all
                        over the world and has made me keen to climb more
                        mountains!

                        In 2020 I was lucky enough to travel all over Sri Lanka.
                        The landscapes are amazing, with really diverse
                        climates, from the tropical southern regions to the more
                        temperate center.
